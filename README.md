# Maximum Element Finder in C

This project demonstrates a simple C program that scans a fixed-size array, displays its contents, and determines the maximum element contained in it.

## Features
- Static array of 10 integers.
- Iterative scan to compute the maximum value.
- Clean output showing both the array and the resulting maximum element.

## File Structure
- `max_element.c` — Main source code implementing the algorithm.

## How It Works
1. The array is initialized with predefined integers.
2. The program prints all elements for reference.
3. A linear scan compares each element to track the maximum value.
4. The final maximum is printed to the console.

## Compilation
Use any standard C compiler:
```
gcc max_element.c -o max_element
./max_element
```
